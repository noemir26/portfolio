  description: Every day updates on the snow condition by user-made snow reports.
  context: Made togheter with 3 other developers, all of them based in Tokyo. In just 10 days, we achieved a fully functional app, with a nice design and a lot of features.
  stack: It was developed using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Git and GitHub. My main tasks were geocoding and styling both the map, with its markers, and the ski resorts cards.
